# 🧠 100 Days of Context Engineering

Every day for 100 days, I publish one production-grade insight on **Context Engineering** — the discipline of designing, structuring, retrieving, and managing the information space that AI models reason over. From prompt architecture to RAG pipelines to memory systems to MCP as the live context delivery protocol.

No theory fluff. Builder-to-builder. 17+ years of financial markets infrastructure informing every pattern.

## 🔄 Why I Changed This from #100DaysOfMCP

I started this series as **#100DaysOfMCP**. Two days in, a respected expert stopped me:

> *"You're describing the pipes. You haven't told anyone what flows through them."*

He was right. **MCP is a protocol** — the standardised wire format for delivering context to AI models. **Context Engineering is the discipline** — the full architecture of what the model knows, when it knows it, in what form, and how much of it.

MCP is Layer 6 of a 6-layer stack. Teaching only MCP is like teaching USB-C without explaining data centres.

So I expanded. The series now covers the complete Context Engineering discipline — with MCP as its most powerful chapter, not its only one.

**The 6-Layer Context Engineering Stack:**
```
Layer 1 — Raw Data Sources        (databases, APIs, documents, streams)
Layer 2 — Chunking & Indexing     (how data becomes retrievable)
Layer 3 — Retrieval & RAG         (dynamic context injection)
Layer 4 — Memory Systems          (short-term, episodic, semantic, long-term)
Layer 5 — Orchestration           (prompt design, instruction hierarchy, agents)
Layer 6 — Protocol Delivery       (MCP — live, composable, production-grade)
```

## 🗺️ Series Curriculum

### ✅ Day 1 — The AI Context Problem
**Phase 1: The WHY**

Every LLM you've used has the same blind spot — it can't see your database, your files, or what happened in your business today. This day defines the **Context Gap**: the root cause of most AI agent failures in production.

**Key insight:** The problem isn't the model. The problem is the architecture.

[→ Read Day 1](./Phase1_WHY/Day-01-The-AI-Context-Problem.md)

---

### ✅ Day 2 — How LLMs Actually Work
**Phase 1: The WHY**

Before building context systems, you need to understand what you're feeding. This day covers tokens, context windows, statelessness, and the critical difference between **parametric knowledge** (baked into weights) and **contextual knowledge** (what you provide at runtime).

**Key insight:** Every inference starts from zero. Context is the only bridge between the model and your world.

---

### ✅ Day 3 — Why I Changed This Series *(Today)*
**Phase 1: The WHY**

The honest story behind moving from **#100DaysOfMCP** to **#100DaysOfContextEngineering**. MCP is a protocol. Context Engineering is the discipline that gives that protocol meaning. This day explains the 6-layer CE stack, where MCP lives within it, and why the full picture matters — especially in high-stakes environments like financial markets where wrong context means wrong decisions.

**Key insight:** You can't engineer a context protocol without first understanding what context engineering is.

---

### ✅ Day 4 — What Is Context Engineering?
**What Is Context Engineering? — The Full Discipline Defined**

Context Engineering is the complete practice of designing, building, maintaining, and optimising the flow of information into AI systems. It covers everything from how many tokens you have and what they cost, to how you retrieve relevant data, maintain agent memory, craft instructions, orchestrate multi-step workflows, and deliver context through standardised protocols.

---

### ✅ Day 5 — Four Types of Context Every LLM Uses
**The 4 Types of Context Every LLM Uses**

The four types are: Parametric, Instructional, Conversational, and Retrieved. Each has distinct properties, distinct failure modes, and distinct engineering requirements.

---

### ✅ Day 6 — The Context Window Is Your Most Valuable Real Estate
**The Context Window Is Your Most Valuable Real Estate**

The context window is a constrained strategic resource. Every token is an investment. Every token in the wrong position reduces the quality of the model's output. And because of a well-documented research finding called "Lost in the Middle," where you place information matters as much as what information you include.

### 🔥 Day 7 — Context Engineering vs Prompt Engineering
** The 5 Enemies of Good Context**

The culprit is almost always one of five context quality enemies: noise, contradiction, staleness, over-compression, and under-specification. These are the silent killers of production AI systems. They're invisible until something breaks, and they're entirely within the Context Engineer's control to prevent.

### 🔜 Day 8 — COMING NEXT
**The Context Window Is Your Most Valuable Real Estate**

Tomorrow will go one level deeper into Context Engineering vs Prompt Engineering in detail..
