### Chain-of-Thought as Context Scaffolding

---

#### 1. The Problem CoT Solves

Transformers operate on **token-by-token probability distribution**. They do not have a "planning phase" where they think before answering. They generate tokens sequentially, committing to each word as it's produced.

This means:
- If a model generates the wrong symbol in Step 1, all downstream analysis is wrong
- But if the wrong symbol is never visible, you don't know where the error happened
- Errors are silent, not loud

**CoT makes errors loud** by forcing them to appear in the reasoning chain.

---

#### 2. How CoT Works: The Architecture

CoT doesn't change the model. It changes the **context structure** that guides the model's output generation.

**Without CoT:**
```
Context: "Analyze this trade"
Model output: "This trade is compliant."
Model's actual reasoning: [hidden inside attention weights, inaccessible]
Problem: Black box. No audit.
```

**With CoT:**
```
Context: "Step 1: Extract... Step 2: Check... Step 3: Compare..."
Model output: 
  Step 1: [visible extraction]
  Step 2: [visible checks]
  Step 3: [visible comparison]
  Decision: [visible final decision]
Problem: White box. Auditable.
```

The context structure scaffolds the model's reasoning process.

#### 3. CoT for Financial Market Decisions

**Scenario:** Validate a derivatives trade before execution.

**Without CoT:**
```
Prompt: "Is this EUR 2.5M swap trade compliant?"
Output: "Yes, compliant."
Problem: What checks were performed? What rules were verified? Unknown.
Compliance Team: [Cannot audit the decision]
```

**With Structured CoT:**
```
Prompt: """
Validate this trade step-by-step.
Step 1: Extract trade attributes
Step 2: Check FX settlement rules (T+2 for all FX)
Step 3: Check position limits (max $2M per counterparty)
Step 4: Check credit limits (min credit score 700)
Step 5: Aggregate position across all venues
Step 6: Make final decision

Trade: [EUR 2.5M swap, counterparty: Bank X, settlement: T+2]
"""

Output:
Step 1: symbol=EUR, size=2.5M, counterparty=Bank X, settlement=T+2
Step 2: FX settlement rule = T+2. Trade settlement = T+2. ✓ PASS
Step 3: Position limit = $2M. Trade size = $2.5M. ✗ FAIL
Step 4: Credit score for Bank X = 750. Min required = 700. ✓ PASS
Step 5: Aggregate position (Bank X) = $3.2M across 3 trades.
Step 6: Decision = DENIED (Rule: Position limit exceeded by $1.2M)

Compliance Team: [Can audit each step, identify the exact violation]
```

#### 4. The Psychology: Why CoT Actually Improves Reasoning

Research shows that when language models generate intermediate reasoning steps, their accuracy improves dramatically (often 40-50% on complex tasks).

Why? Three reasons:

**Reason 1: Token Commitment**
By generating intermediate steps, the model "commits" to intermediate conclusions. These constrain subsequent tokens. This creates a forcing function where errors become apparent.

**Reason 2: Attention Reordering**
When the model must generate "Step 1: ...," "Step 2: ..." it patterns-matches to chains in training data. It's more likely to follow a logical sequence instead of jumping conclusions.

**Reason 3: Backtracking Prevention**
Once a step is generated, it's in the context for subsequent steps. This prevents the model from "changing its mind" mid-reasoning. Consistency is forced.

#### 5. Structured CoT Patterns for Production

**Pattern 1: Linear Chain (Simple)**
```python
def linear_cot(trade_data):
    prompt = """
    Analyze the trade step-by-step:
    
    Step 1: Extract the trade size in USD equivalent.
    Step 2: Compare against the counterparty position limit.
    Step 3: Determine compliance status.
    Step 4: Return decision in JSON format.
    
    Trade: {trade_data}
    """
    return call_claude(prompt)
```

**Pattern 2: Branching Chain (Complex)**
```python
def branching_cot(trade_data):
    prompt = """
    Step 1: Determine trade type (FX / Derivative / Commodity).
    
    IF trade type = FX:
        Step 2a: Check T+2 settlement rule.
        Step 3a: Validate currency pair against approved list.
    ELSE IF trade type = Derivative:
        Step 2b: Check initial margin requirement.
        Step 3b: Validate clearinghouse acceptance.
    
    Step 4: Aggregate findings and return decision.
    
    Trade: {trade_data}
    """
    return call_claude(prompt)
```

**Pattern 3: Self-Checking Chain (Robust)**
```python
def self_checking_cot(trade_data):
    prompt = """
    Step 1: Extract and validate trade attributes.
    Step 2: Run compliance checks.
    Step 3: List any violations found.
    Step 4: Double-check each violation (restate the rule, confirm the violation).
    Step 5: If unsure about any violation, escalate (don't guess).
    Step 6: Return final decision.
    
    Trade: {trade_data}
    
    IMPORTANT: In Step 4, you must explicitly confirm each violation.
    Do not skip this step.
    """
    return call_claude(prompt)
```

#### 6. CoT in Practice: A Real Financial Example

**Market Scenario:**
A trader submits a $2.8M EUR/USD spot trade with counterparty "Morgan Stanley" at 9:45 AM London time.

**Compliance Rule Set:**
- FX trades must settle T+2 (2 business days)
- Position limit per counterparty: $2M
- Trades submitted after 4 PM London time are automatically escalated
- Morgan Stanley has a credit limit of $3M

**With CoT:**

```
Input: {symbol: EUR, amount: 2.8M, counterparty: Morgan Stanley, time: 0945}

Step 1: Extraction
- Extracted symbol: EUR/USD
- Extracted amount: $2.8M USD equivalent
- Extracted counterparty: Morgan Stanley
- Extracted submission time: 09:45 London time

Step 2: Settlement Rule Check
- Rule: FX trades require T+2 settlement
- Trade settlement: T+2 (trade date today, settlement in 2 business days)
- Status: ✓ PASS

Step 3: Position Limit Check
- Rule: Position limit per counterparty = $2M
- Current position (Morgan Stanley): $1.2M from earlier trades today
- New position if trade approved: $1.2M + $2.8M = $4M
- Status: ✗ FAIL (Position $4M > Limit $2M)

Step 4: Credit Limit Check
- Rule: Counterparty credit limit = $3M
- Total notional at credit risk: $4M (if trade approved)
- Status: ✗ FAIL (Total $4M > Credit limit $3M)

Step 5: Time-of-Day Check
- Rule: Trades after 4 PM London = Automatic escalation
- Submission time: 09:45 London
- Status: ✓ PASS (within business hours)

Step 6: Violation Summary
- Violation 1: Position limit exceeded ($4M vs $2M limit)
- Violation 2: Credit limit exceeded ($4M vs $3M limit)

Step 7: Decision
- Result: DENIED
- Reason: Exceeds both position and credit limits
- Escalation: Notify compliance team for potential override
```

This output is:
- **Auditable:** Every step is visible
- **Debuggable:** If you disagree with the decision, you can point to the exact step
- **Defensible:** Regulators can see the reasoning chain

#### 7. Common CoT Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Vague Steps**
```
Bad: "Step 1: Think about the trade."
Good: "Step 1: Extract the following fields: symbol, size, counterparty, settlement_date."
```

**Mistake 2: Too Many Steps**
```
Bad: 15 steps (model gets confused, skips steps)
Good: 5-7 steps (clear, traceable)
```

**Mistake 3: No Checkpoints**
```
Bad: Reasoning steps but no explicit rule checks
Good: Each step ends with a ✓ PASS or ✗ FAIL marker
```

**Mistake 4: Implicit Aggregation**
```
Bad: Multiple violations but no summary
Good: Step N: "Violations found: [list]. Decision: [final]"
```
